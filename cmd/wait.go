	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	waitCmd.PersistentFlags().DurationVar(&timeout, "timeout", 10, "Timeout in seconds")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// waitCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
